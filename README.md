The Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) is a cutting-edge project designed to optimize urban traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety by leveraging advanced technologies like Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and IoT. The system dynamically monitors and manages traffic conditions in real-time using smart algorithms and data-driven insights.

Features:

Real-Time Traffic Monitoring: Uses AI-powered object detection (e.g., YOLO, OpenCV) to identify vehicles and pedestrians.
Smart Traffic Lights: Adaptive signal control adjusts timings based on real-time traffic density.
Automated Incident Detection: Identifies accidents, stalled vehicles, and alerts authorities instantly.
Vehicle Recognition System: Implements ANPR to track rule violations and issue automated fines.
Predictive Analytics: Forecasts traffic patterns for proactive management and planning.
Public Integration: Provides live traffic updates and route suggestions through user-friendly interfaces.
Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python (primary)
Frameworks and Libraries: OpenCV, YOLO, TensorFlow
UI/UX Development: Tkinter for desktop applications, React or Flutter for mobile apps
Database: MySQL, MongoDB
Cloud Integration: AWS or Azure IoT for scalable real-time analytics
Hardware: IoT sensors, IP cameras, edge computing devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson)
This project is ideal for urban planners, law enforcement agencies, and tech enthusiasts aiming to revolutionize traffic systems.
